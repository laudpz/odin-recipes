    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an easy, 30-minute recipe with smoky, roasted cauliflower and a
      spicy romesco-inspired sauce. It's also plant-based, gluten-free, and
      oil-free optional and grain-free optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would make the perfect healthy, satisfying weeknight meal when you
      don't have much time to cook. The cauliflower could be roasted ahead of
      time and reheated in the oven or stovetop if you're short on time. And the
      sauce lasts up to 1 week in the refrigerator, so it can also easily be
      made ahead of time to enjoy throughout the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the cauliflower is roasting, make your sauce, which is comprised of
      roasted almonds, roasted and fresh garlic, fire-roasted tomatoes, lime
      juice, spices, chipotle peppers, and a little maple syrup. The result is a
      smoky, tangy, spicy, well-balanced sauce that's thick and creamy and
      perfect for these cauliflower tacos.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and add cauliflower to 2 large
        baking sheets (use more baking sheets if increasing batch size). Add oil
        (or omit/sub water), cumin, chili powder, paprika, and salt. Toss to
        combine and roast on the bottom rack for 20-25 minutes or until golden
        brown and tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        To a separate baking sheet, add raw almonds and the 4 unpeeled garlic
        cloves (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch
        size). Roast on the center rack for 10-12 minutes, checking at the 8
        minute mark. If the almonds are dark brown and cracking, remove from the
        oven to avoid burning, but continue cooking garlic until light golden
        brown and slightly softened. Remove from oven and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        While cauliflower finishes roasting, add drained, fire-roasted tomatoes
        to a high-speed blender along with almonds, roasted garlic (peeled), raw
        garlic (peeled), oil (or water), lime juice, paprika, cumin, salt, maple
        syrup, and chipotle peppers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.
        Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime for acidity, garlic
        for kick/zing, salt for saltiness, paprika or cumin for smokiness, maple
        syrup to offset heat/add sweetness, or chipotle peppers for more heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, warm tortillas in the microwave or in the oven directly on the
        still-warm oven racks until pliable. Then add 1-2 Tbsp of the romesco
        sauce and a generous portion of cauliflower. Serve as is or garnish with
        lime juice/wedges, cilantro, cabbage, and/or pepitas (optional).
      </li>
      <li>
        Best when fresh. Store leftover sauce in the refrigerator up to 1 week
        (or 1 month in the freezer), and the cauliflower in the refrigerator up
        to 3 days. Reheat cauliflower in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until warm
        (best when fresh).

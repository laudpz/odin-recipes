    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      All you need are 3 ingredients to make your favorite margarita recipe!
    </p>
    <p>
      By contrast to many of the diluted, super-sweet, and sometimes fizzy huge
      mugs of margaritas that are often served in restaurants around the world
      nowadays, a traditional margarita is actually a strong, tart cocktail made
      with three simple ingredients — good-quality tequila, orange liqueur, and
      freshly-squeezed lime juice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple margarita mix is incredibly quick and easy to make, either for
      a single serving or a larger batch for a crowd. And it is downright
      delicious served on the rocks, with or without a salted rim.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      To make the best margarita mix, all you really need are three basic
      margarita ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tequila: Silver or reposado is traditionally considered to be the best
        tequila for margaritas, but any type of tequila (or smoky mezcal or
        sotol) will work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Freshly-squeezed lime juice: For the best fresh flavor, I highly
        recommend juicing your own limes versus using store-bought lime juice. I
        swear by this citrus juicer, which makes juicing a breeze and comes in
        especially handy if you are making a large batch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Orange liqueur: Cointreau is my go-to, but Grand Marnier is also
        delicious or you can use a good-quality Triple Sec.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p>You are also welcome to add:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Agave: If you would like to sweeten your margarita, I recommend adding
        agave syrup (or simple syrup, or any other sweetener you prefer) to
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kosher salt: If you would like to salt the rims of your glasses, run a
        lime wedge around the rims and then dip them in coarse Kosher salt or
        margarita salt. (I also like to mix some Tajín into my salt to give it
        an extra chili-lime kick.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional lime slices/wedges: Save a few extra lime slices or wedges if
        you would like to add them to the glass as garnish.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep your glasses: If you would like to salt the rim of your glass,
        simply run a juicy lime wedge around the rim and then dip the rim in
        coarse Kosher salt. Set the glass aside until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the ingredients in a cocktail shaker: Combine the tequila, lime
        juice, orange liqueur, and a few ice cubes in a cocktail shaker. (Or
        alternately if you do not have a cocktail shaker, you can stir the
        ingredients together in a measuring cup or shake them together in a
        mason jar.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Shake shake shake: Give the mixture a good shake (or a good stir!) for
        about 10 seconds or until chilled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and add sweetener, if desired: Give the margarita mix a taste and
        if you think it needs extra sweetener, add in a teaspoon or two of agave
        (or simple syrup) at a time until the mix reaches your desired level of
        sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain and serve on the rocks. Place a few ice cubes (or I often use one
        large ice cube so that it will melt more slowly) in the serving glass,
        then strain the margarita mix over the ice and garnish with a slice of
        lime.
      </li>
    </ol>

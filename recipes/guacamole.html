    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Guacamole is an avocado-based dip or spread that originated in Mexico.
      It's typically made with mashed avocado and lime juice, then seasoned with
      salt and cilantro. Guacamole often contains tomatoes and onions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the best guacamole recipe as it's simple to make and uses fresh,
      high-quality ingredients. Authentic guacamole doesn't contain fillers and
      unnecessary ingredients. Easy and delicious!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      With just 8 simple ingredients you can make one of the all-time-best dip
      recipes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Avocados: I've got a few tips for picking ripe ones below.</li>
      <li>
        Onion: I'm using yellow onion which is most often used in Mexico, but
        you could use red onion as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tomatoes: Choose Roma tomatoes which are less juicy. No one wants a
        watery guac.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cilantro: One of my favorite herbs and a staple in Mexican cuisine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jalapeno: You can also use serrano pepper for a little extra heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garlic: Some people like their guac with garlic, others like it without.
        I love just a little.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lime: Freshly squeezed lime is a must. Don't use jarred lime juice as
        the flavor is muted.
      </li>
      <li>Salt: A pinch of flakey salt brings it all together.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice three ripe avocados in half, remove the pit and scoop them into a
        mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a fork to gently mash them to your desired level of chunky or
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, garlic, lime juice
        and salt and stir everything together.
      </li>
    </ol>
